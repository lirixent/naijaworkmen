* **Document Upload & Verification System** — Users upload ID, certificates, CVs or passports; admin can verify and approve to ensure trust and quality.
* **Flexible Services Beyond Jobs** — Users can also request additional services (real estate help, construction, business‑development, etc.), making the platform versatile and comprehensive.
